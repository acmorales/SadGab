# SadGab
## What is it?
SadGab is a rudimentary string generator based on the popular word game MadGab. A string is inputted then a string with matching syllable pronunciation (if one exists) is outputted.
## Why did we make it?
It’s a pet project born from HackTX 2014 that we decided to keep tinkering with.
## Ok, what’s it for?
Aside from being a neat little game, we periodically revisit SadGab as we learn more and try to apply new knowledge to it.
